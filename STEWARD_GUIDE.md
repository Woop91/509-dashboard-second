When you update information for a less-active member, you're:
- 🔥 **Reigniting their connection** to the union
- 💡 **Opening doors** for future conversations
- 🛡️ **Ensuring they're protected** when they need us
- 🌍 **Showing them they belong** to something bigger

**Every less-active member you update is a potential future leader!**

**Positive Mindset**: "I'm discovering members who need connection!"

#### Week 2: The Outreach Phase 📞
**Goal**: Contact 3 of those members to update their info

**Sample Script (Warm & Welcoming):**
> *"Hi [Name]! This is [Your Name] from Local 509. I'm updating our member directory to make sure we can reach everyone. Do you have a few minutes to confirm your contact info? We want to make sure you're getting all the updates and support you deserve!"*

**Celebrate**: Every call you make = **one member feeling valued!** 🎊

**Focus Areas** (Pick What You Can Find):
- ✅ Phone number
- ✅ Email address
- ✅ Preferred contact method
- ✅ Emergency contact
- ✅ Committee interests
- ✅ Office days/location
- ✅ Engagement notes

**Victory Lap**: Look at those completed profiles! **You did that!** 🏆

#### Week 4: The Celebration Phase 🎉
**Goal**: Reflect on your impact

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- How many members can we now reach who we couldn't before?
- Did any of these members seem happy to hear from you?
- Do you feel more connected to your members?
