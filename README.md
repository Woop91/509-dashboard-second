### Technical Details

**Language**: Google Apps Script (JavaScript ES6)
**Runtime**: Google Apps Script V8 Runtime
**Permissions Required**:
- Google Sheets API access
- Ability to create/modify sheets
- Ability to add custom menus

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Batch writing (1000 rows at a time for seeding)
- SpreadsheetApp.flush() for immediate updates
- Hidden analytics sheet to reduce visual clutter
- Formula-based calculations instead of script calculations where possible

### Database Design

The system uses a **normalized sheet structure**:

1. **Config** = Master reference tables
2. **Member Directory** = Member entity (1 row = 1 member)
3. **Grievance Log** = Grievance entity (1 row = 1 grievance)
4. **Relationships**: Member Directory ← Member ID → Grievance Log

This prevents data duplication and ensures consistency.

### 5. Data Seeding Functions

**Purpose**: Generate realistic test data for training and testing

**SEED_MEMBERS(count, grievancePercent)** - Seeds members with optional grievances
- `count` - Number of members to seed (max 2,000)
- `grievancePercent` - Percentage of members to give grievances (0-100, default 30%)
- All grievances are directly linked to member data (Member ID, Name, Email, etc.)
- Realistic names, job titles, locations, units
- Batch writes 50 rows at a time

**Menu Options:**
- **Seed Members & Grievances (Custom)** - Prompts for member count (30% get grievances)
- **Seed Members (Advanced)** - Prompts for count AND grievance percentage
- **Seed 50 Members (30% Grievances)** - Quick seed option
- **Seed 100 Members (50% Grievances)** - Quick seed with more grievances

**NUKE_SEEDED_DATA()** - Clears all member and grievance data

**Limits**: Max 2,000 members per call (prevents timeout)

**Example Usage:**
- `SEED_MEMBERS(100)` - Seeds 100 members, ~30 grievances
- `SEED_MEMBERS(100, 50)` - Seeds 100 members, ~50 grievances
- `SEED_MEMBERS(100, 0)` - Seeds 100 members only, no grievances

### 6. Hidden Sheet Architecture (v3.40+)

**Purpose**: Automatic cross-sheet data synchronization using hidden calculation sheets

**The 4 Hidden Sheets**:

| Hidden Sheet | Source | Destination | Columns Updated |
|--------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `_Grievance_Calc` | Grievance Log | Member Directory | AB-AD (Has Open Grievance, Status, Deadline) |
| `_Member_Lookup` | Member Directory | Grievance Log | C-D (Names), X-AA (Email, Unit, Location, Steward) |
| `_Steward_Contact_Calc` | Communications Log | Member Directory | Y-AA (Contact Date, Steward, Notes) |
| `_Engagement_Calc` | Meeting Attendance + Volunteer Hours | Member Directory | Q-T (Last Meetings, Vol Hours) |

**How It Works**:
1. User edits a source sheet (e.g., changes member email in Member Directory)
2. onEdit trigger fires automatically
3. Hidden sheet recalculates formulas (MAP/LAMBDA)
4. Calculated values sync to destination sheet as static values

**Key Functions**:
- `REPAIR_DASHBOARD()` - Recreates all 6 hidden sheets + reinstalls triggers
- `VERIFY_HIDDEN_SHEETS()` - Diagnoses sync issues without changing anything

**Menu Access**: Administrator → Setup & Triggers → Verify Hidden Sheets

---

- Control how many members get grievances (0-100%)

### Benefits of Merged Approach
- All grievances are directly linked to actual member data
- No orphaned grievances with missing member info
- Single operation seeds both members and their grievances
- Avoids Google Apps Script timeout limits (max 2,000 members per call)

### Clear Data Options
- **Nuke Seed Data (Exit Demo Mode)**: Removes core test data, sets SEED_NUKED flag, shows post-nuke guidance
  - Access via: **⚙️ Administrator > Seed Functions > 🚨 Nuke Seed Data (Exit Demo Mode)**
- **Nuke ALL Sheet Data (Comprehensive)**: Clears ALL sheets including analytics, surveys, feedback, archive
  - Access via: **⚙️ Administrator > Seed Functions > 🗑️ Nuke ALL Sheet Data (Comprehensive)**
- **Clear Core Data Only**: Clears only Member Directory and Grievance Log
  - Access via: **⚙️ Administrator > Seed Functions > ⚠️ Clear Core Data Only**

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Member

1. Go to **Member Directory** sheet
2. Click on the first empty row
3. Enter Member ID (format: M + first 2 chars of first/last name + 3 digits, e.g., MJASM123)
4. Fill in name, contact info
5. Use dropdowns for:
   - Job Title (from Config)
   - Work Location (from Config)
   - Unit (from Config)
   - Supervisor, Manager, Assigned Steward (from Config)
6. Fill in engagement data as available
7. Grievance columns (26-28) will auto-populate if the member has grievances

### Example 2: Logging a New Grievance

1. Go to **Grievance Log** sheet
2. Click on the first empty row
3. Enter:
   - Grievance ID (format: G + first 2 chars of first/last name + 3 digits, e.g., GJASM456)
   - Member ID (must match Member Directory)
   - Member name
   - **Incident Date** (when it happened)
   - **Date Filed** (when you filed it)
4. Select from dropdowns:
   - Status (usually "Open")
   - Current Step (usually "Informal" or "Step I")
   - Issue Category
   - Articles Violated
   - Assigned Steward
5. Watch as the system automatically calculates:
   - Filing Deadline (Incident + 21d)
   - Step I Decision Due (Filed + 30d)
   - Days Open
   - Next Action Due
   - Days to Deadline

### Example 3: Tracking a Grievance Through Steps

**Scenario**: Grievance filed, Step I decision received, now appealing to Step II

1. Find the grievance row in **Grievance Log**
2. Enter **Step I Decision Rcvd** date (column K)
3. System automatically calculates **Step II Appeal Due** (Decision + 10d)
4. When you file Step II appeal:
   - Enter **Step II Appeal Filed** date (column M)
   - Update **Current Step** to "Step II"
   - System calculates **Step II Decision Due** (Appeal + 30d)
5. **Next Action Due** automatically updates to show Step II decision deadline
6. Member Directory grievance snapshot updates automatically

### Example 4: Closing a Grievance

1. Go to the grievance row in **Grievance Log**
2. Update **Status** to "Settled" (or "Withdrawn", "Closed")
3. Enter **Date Closed**
4. Fill in **Resolution Summary** (brief description of outcome)
5. System automatically:
   - Calculates total **Days Open** (Date Closed - Date Filed)
   - Clears **Next Action Due** (no more deadlines)
   - Updates **Member Directory** grievance snapshot
6. Dashboard "Open Grievances" count decreases automatically

### Example 5: Adding a New Location to Config

**Scenario**: Local 509 opens a new office in "Framingham"

1. Go to **Config** tab
2. Find the "Office Locations" column (Column B)
3. Scroll to the first empty cell in that column
4. Type "Framingham Office"
5. Immediately, all dropdowns in:
   - Member Directory → Work Location
   - Grievance Log → Work Location
   ...now include "Framingham Office" as an option

### Example 6: Generating Test Data

**For Training or Testing**:

1. Click **⚙️ Administrator** menu
2. Select **Seed Functions > Seed Members > Seed Members - Toggle 1 (5,000)**
3. Repeat for additional member batches if needed (Toggle 2, 3, 4 for up to 20k total)
4. Select **Seed Functions > Seed Grievances > Seed Grievances - Toggle 1 (2,500)**
5. Repeat for additional grievance batch if needed (Toggle 2 for up to 5k total)
6. Go to **Dashboard > Dashboards > Main Dashboard** to see populated metrics
7. Use **Administrator > Seed Functions > 🚨 Nuke Seed Data (Exit Demo Mode)** when done testing

**Note**: The toggle-based approach allows for incremental data generation to avoid timeouts

### Example 7: Monthly Report Generation

**Scenario**: You need member engagement stats for the monthly chapter meeting

1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Note the metrics:
   - Total Members
   - Active Stewards
   - Open Grievances count
   - Engagement metrics (last 30 days)
3. Check **Upcoming Deadlines** table for grievances needing attention
4. Go to **Member Directory** and filter:
   - Interest: Local Actions = "Yes"
   - Last Virtual Mtg >= (30 days ago)
5. Export this filtered list for targeted outreach
6. Go to **Grievance Log** and filter by Status = "Open" to review active cases

### Example 8: Tracking Steward Workload

**Scenario**: Want to see how many open grievances each steward is handling

1. Go to **Grievance Log**
2. Click Data → Create a filter
3. Filter **Status** = "Open"
4. Filter **Assigned Steward** = specific steward name
5. Count visible rows to see their caseload
6. OR check the **💼 Dashboard** tab which shows Top 30 Busiest Stewards ranked by active cases

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Menus "👤 Dashboard", "📊 Sheet Manager", or "⚙️ Administrator" don't appear

**Solution**:
- Close and reopen the Google Sheet
- Check that the script is saved: Extensions > Apps Script
- Run `onOpen()` manually from script editor (or `onOpen_Reorganized()` if using reorganized menu)
- Check permissions: Apps Script may need authorization on first run
- Ensure Code.gs has the correct menu structure implemented

### Issue: Formulas showing #REF! errors

**Cause**: Sheet names don't match expected names

**Solution**:
- Ensure sheets are named exactly:
  - "Member Directory" (not "Member-Directory" or "Members")
  - "Grievance Log" (not "Grievances")
  - "Config" (not "Configuration")
- Re-run `CREATE_509_DASHBOARD()` to recreate sheets with correct names

### Issue: Dropdowns not showing values from Config

**Cause**: Data validation not set up or Config tab modified

**Solution**:
1. Check **Config** tab has values in the right columns
2. Go to Apps Script editor
3. Run `setupDataValidations()` function manually
4. Or re-run full `CREATE_509_DASHBOARD()` setup

### Issue: Seeding functions timeout or fail

**Cause**: Google Apps Script execution time limit (6 minutes)

**Solution**:
- Reduce batch size in code (change BATCH_SIZE constant)
- Run in smaller chunks (modify functions to seed 5k at a time instead of 20k)
- For very large datasets, consider importing CSV data instead

### Issue: Deadline calculations not working

**Cause**: Formulas not set up in Grievance Log

**Solution**:
1. Go to Apps Script editor
2. Run `setupFormulasAndCalculations()` manually
3. Check that date columns have actual dates (not text)
4. Verify formulas exist in columns H, J, L, N, P, S, T, U

### Issue: Member Directory grievance snapshot not updating

**Cause**: Hidden sheets or triggers not installed (v3.40+ architecture)

**Solution**:
1. Run **Administrator → Setup & Triggers → 🔍 Verify Hidden Sheets**
2. If issues found, run `REPAIR_DASHBOARD()` from Apps Script
3. This recreates the `_Grievance_Calc` hidden sheet and installs the sync trigger

### Issue: Grievance Log member data (C-D, X-AA) not updating

**Cause**: Hidden `_Member_Lookup` sheet or trigger missing

**Solution**:
1. Run `VERIFY_HIDDEN_SHEETS()` to diagnose
2. Run `REPAIR_DASHBOARD()` to recreate all hidden sheets and triggers
3. Or run `setupMemberLookupSheet()` + `installMemberSyncTrigger()` individually

### Issue: Engagement columns Q-T are blank

**Cause**: Engagement source sheets or hidden sheet not created

**Solution**:
1. Run **Administrator → Setup & Triggers → 📅 Setup Engagement Tracking**
2. This creates Meeting Attendance sheet, Volunteer Hours sheet, and `_Engagement_Calc` hidden sheet
3. Enter data in the source sheets - Member Directory Q-T will auto-populate

### Issue: Dashboard showing #DIV/0! or #N/A errors

**Cause**: No data in Member Directory or Grievance Log yet

**Solution**:
- Errors are normal when sheets are empty
- Add at least one member and one grievance, or
- Run seed functions to populate with test data
- Formulas will calculate correctly once data exists

### Issue: "Cannot read property of null" script error

**Cause**: Sheet doesn't exist

**Solution**:
- Run `CREATE_509_DASHBOARD()` to create all required sheets
- Check that you haven't renamed or deleted any sheets
- Sheet names are case-sensitive

### Issue: Data validation allows invalid values

**Cause**: User typed instead of using dropdown, or validation rule removed

**Solution**:
1. Re-run `setupDataValidations()` from Apps Script
2. Educate users to always use dropdowns, not typing
3. Regularly audit data with filters to find inconsistent values

### Issue: Performance is slow with large datasets

**Optimization tips**:
- Avoid opening all sheets at once
- Use filters instead of scrolling through thousands of rows
- Hide unused sheets
- Clear formatting from unused cells
- Consider archiving old closed grievances to a separate sheet

### Issue: Want to customize deadline timelines (not 21/30/10 days)

**Solution**:
1. Go to Apps Script editor
2. Find `setupFormulasAndCalculations()` function
3. Modify the formulas:
   - Line with `G${row}+21` → change 21 to your filing deadline days
   - Line with `I${row}+30` → change 30 to your Step I decision days
   - Line with `K${row}+10` → change 10 to your Step II appeal days
   - etc.
4. Save and run the function to update all formulas

## 📌 Best Practices

1. **Always use dropdowns** - Don't type values that should come from Config
2. **Keep Config clean** - Remove unused values, fix typos in Config (not in data sheets)
3. **Use consistent Member IDs** - Format: M + first 2 chars of first name + first 2 chars of last name + 3 random digits (e.g., MJASM123)
4. **Enter dates promptly** - Grievance calculations depend on accurate dates
5. **Review deadlines weekly** - Check Dashboard "Upcoming Deadlines" regularly
6. **Archive old data** - Move closed grievances older than 2 years to archive sheet
7. **Back up regularly** - File > Make a copy periodically
8. **Train users** - Ensure all stewards understand the system before using
9. **Test before production** - Use seed functions to test, then clear before real use
10. **Document customizations** - If you modify Config lists or formulas, document changes

## 🔒 Data Privacy & Security

- **Access Control**: Use Google Sheets sharing settings to control who can view/edit
- **Member Data**: Contains PII (names, emails, phone numbers) - restrict access appropriately
- **Grievance Confidentiality**: Limit access to union staff and authorized stewards only
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups recommended (Google Sheets has version history)
- **Export Restrictions**: Be cautious about exporting member lists to CSV/Excel

## 📝 Notes

- Dashboard metrics refresh automatically when data changes
- Grievance deadlines calculated based on contract rules (21/30/10 day timelines)
- Member grievance status auto-populates from Grievance Log
- All dropdowns controlled centrally via Config tab
- No fake data - everything traces back to actual records
- System supports up to ~100,000 rows per sheet (Google Sheets limit: 10M cells total)
