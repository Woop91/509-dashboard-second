## 📊 Understanding Test Results

### Summary Section
- **Total Tests:** Number of tests run
- **✅ Passed:** Tests that succeeded
- **❌ Failed:** Tests that need attention
- **⏭️ Skipped:** Tests not implemented yet
- **Pass Rate:** Percentage of passing tests
- **Duration:** How long tests took

### Goal: 100% Pass Rate

## 🔧 What Tests Cover

### Critical (Must Pass 100%)
- ✅ **Filing Deadlines** - 21 days from incident
- ✅ **Step I Deadlines** - 30 days from filing
- ✅ **Step II Deadlines** - 10 days from Step I decision
- ✅ **Days Open** - Accurate day counts
- ✅ **Data Validation** - Dropdowns work correctly

### Important (70%+ Pass Rate)
- ✅ **Member Creation** - Test member generation
- ✅ **Grievance Linking** - Members link to grievances
- ✅ **Dashboard Updates** - Metrics update automatically
- ✅ **Data Clearing** - Headers preserved when clearing

### Integration (80%+ Pass Rate)
- ✅ **Complete Workflow** - Grievance lifecycle from start to finish
- ✅ **Snapshot Updates** - Member directory syncs with grievances
- ✅ **Performance** - Operations complete in reasonable time

## ❌ If Tests Fail

### Common Issues

**1. Formulas Not Calculating**
- **Fix:** Wait 10 seconds and re-run tests
- **Why:** Formulas need time to recalculate

**2. Test Timeout**
- **Fix:** Run smaller test groups
- **Why:** Google limits script execution to 6 minutes

**3. Test Data Not Cleaned**
- **Fix:** Go to Member Directory, delete rows starting with "TEST-"
- **Why:** Previous test run may have crashed

### Get Help
1. Check error message in Test Results sheet

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Run Tests After Setup
After running `CREATE_509_DASHBOARD()`, run tests to verify everything works.

### Tip 2: Check Test Results Regularly
Keep the "Test Results" sheet visible to track quality over time.

### Tip 3: Clean Test Data
If you see rows with IDs starting with "TEST-", it's safe to delete them.

### Tip 4: Use Single Test Function
To debug a specific test:
```javascript
// In Apps Script Editor
runSingleTest('testFilingDeadlineCalculation');
```

### Tip 5: Test Before Seeding
Run tests on empty sheets before seeding 20k members to ensure setup is correct.
