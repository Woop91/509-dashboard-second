# 🚨 Seed & Nuke Features

## Overview

The **Demo Menu** provides two key features:

1. **Seed All Sample Data** - Seeds 1,000 members + 300 grievances + auto-installs the sync trigger
2. **Nuke Seeded Data** - Removes all test/seeded data and transitions to production mode

After seeding, Member Directory columns (Has Open Grievance?, Grievance Status, Days to Deadline) **automatically update** when you edit the Grievance Log.

### Simplified Demo Menu

## 🚀 Seed All Sample Data

When you run **Seed All Sample Data**, the system will:

1. **Seed Config dropdowns** - Job Titles, Locations, Units, Supervisors, etc.
2. **Seed 1,000 members** - Unique member records with contact info
3. **Seed 300 grievances** - Randomly distributed (some members may have multiple)
4. **Install auto-sync trigger** - Enables live updates between sheets

### Live Wiring

After seeding, the auto-sync trigger provides **live updates**:

| When You Edit... | These Columns Auto-Update |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Grievance Log Status | Member Directory: Has Open Grievance? |
| Grievance Log Status/Step | Member Directory: Grievance Status |
| Grievance Log Dates | Member Directory: Days to Deadline |

Updates happen within 1-3 seconds of editing.

## ⚠️ What Does "Nuke Seeded Data" Do?

When you execute the **Nuke Seeded Data** function, the system will:

### Data Removal
1. **Remove ALL Members**: Delete all test members from Member Directory
2. **Remove ALL Grievances**: Delete all test grievances from Grievance Log
3. **Clear Steward Workload**: Remove all test steward assignments
4. **Clear Config Demo Data**: Remove demo entries from Config tab (if any exist):
   - Job Titles (Column A)
   - Office Locations (Column B)
   - Units (Column C)
   - Supervisors (Column F)
   - Managers (Column G)
   - Stewards (Column H)
   - Grievance Coordinators (Column O)
   - Home Towns (Column AF)
   - Office Addresses (Column AN)

   > **NOTE (v3.11+):** These fields are now LEFT EMPTY during CREATE_509_DASHBOARD. Users populate them with their own data. If no user data was added, there's nothing to clear.

### Code Removal (Zero Trace Guarantee)
5. **Disable Demo Mode**: Sets DEMO_MODE_DISABLED flag
6. **Remove Demo Menu**: The 🎭 Demo menu will be hidden on next refresh
7. **Clear Tracked IDs**: Removes seeded member/grievance ID tracking

### Preserved Items
9. **Preserve Organization Info**: Keep your real organization settings:
   - Organization Name, Local Number, Main Address, Phone
   - Union Parent, State/Region, Website
   - Main Fax, Toll Free numbers
   - All deadline and contract reference columns
10. **Preserve Structure**: Keep all headers, formulas, and sheet structure intact
11. **Show Setup Guide**: Display getting started instructions

> **🔴 IMPORTANT**: After the nuke completes, there will be **ZERO trace** that seed OR nuke functionality ever existed in your spreadsheet or script code. The SeedNuke.gs file is completely deleted, not just emptied. This is a permanent, irreversible operation.

## 🎬 Post-Nuke Setup Steps

After nuking, follow these steps to set up for production:

### 1. Configure Steward Contact Info

**Location**: `⚙️ Config > Column U`

Enter:
- **Row 2**: Steward Name
- **Row 3**: Steward Email
- **Row 4**: Steward Phone

Or use: `509 Tools > ⚖️ Grievance Tools > ⚙️ Setup Steward Contact Info`

Verify these match your organization:
- Job Titles (Column A)
- Work Locations (Column B)
- Units (Column C)
- Grievance Types (Column G)
- Committee Types (Column L)

Add, remove, or modify as needed.

### 3. Add Real Members

**Location**: `👥 Member Directory`

You can:
- **Manual Entry**: Type directly into the sheet
- **CSV Import**: Use File > Import
- **Copy/Paste**: From another spreadsheet

Required fields:
- Member ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Is Steward (Yes/No)

### 4. Set Up Triggers

**Menu**: `509 Tools > ⚙️ Utilities > Setup Triggers`

This enables:
- Automatic deadline calculations
- Real-time dashboard updates

## 🔄 Can I Undo the Nuke?

**No, the nuke is permanent and irreversible.**

The nuke not only deletes seed data but also **permanently removes all seed code** from the script itself. After nuking:
- Seed functions no longer exist in the code
- SeedNuke.gs is replaced with a minimal stub
- The seed menu is completely removed
- There is **zero trace** of seed functionality

**Recovery options:**
- **Restore from backup**: If you made a copy of the spreadsheet AND script before nuking
- **Fresh deployment**: Deploy a new copy from the original source code
- **Import data**: Add your real data to start fresh (recommended approach)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Dashboards Still Show Data

**Solution**:
- Go to `509 Tools > 📊 Data Management > Rebuild Dashboard`
- This recalculates all metrics

### Problem: Seed Menu Still Visible

**Solution**:
- Close and reopen the spreadsheet
- The menu is rebuilt on open

### Problem: Need to Re-Seed for Training

**Solution**:
Since seed functions are permanently deleted after nuking, you cannot re-seed:
1. Deploy a fresh copy from the original source code
2. Or restore from a backup made BEFORE the nuke
3. The `resetNukeFlag()` function no longer restores seed capabilities

### Problem: Accidentally Nuked Too Soon

**Solution**:
- If you have a backup copy, restore from there
- If no backup, you'll need to import your data manually
- For future: Always make a backup first!

## 🔧 Apps Script API Requirement

For the **automatic code removal** feature to work, the Apps Script API must be enabled:

### Enabling the Apps Script API

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (or create one linked to your script)
3. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Library**
4. Search for "Apps Script API"
5. Click **Enable**

### Required OAuth Scope

The script needs this OAuth scope for automatic code removal:
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.projects
```

### What Happens Without the API?

If the Apps Script API is not enabled:
- All **data** will still be cleared (members, grievances, config demo data)
- Seed **code** will NOT be automatically removed
- You'll see a message with manual cleanup instructions
- You can manually delete seed functions from the Apps Script editor

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### Before Nuking

1. **Make a backup copy**: File > Make a copy
2. **Document your needs**: List required config changes
3. **Prepare import data**: Have member/grievance CSVs ready
4. **Train your team**: Everyone understands the workflow

### After Nuking

1. **Start small**: Add a few test members first
2. **Verify calculations**: Check that auto-calculations work
3. **Test workflows**: Try the grievance workflow with test data
4. **Gradual rollout**: Add real data in batches
5. **Monitor performance**: Watch how dashboards update
